# Test1
test for Dakota

This is developed in VS code and Java
Download the whole hthiing then open the folder in VS code.  If that doesnt work then create a new Java VS code project
then add the selenium libraries as references and add JUnit via the extesions.  Run the test in the "tests" file.
This works perfect in VS code and I find the correct coin every time.

Note, nice try adding TWO reset buttons.  It causes your initial attempt to fail because you have two buttons with the same ID. Been there done that lol
